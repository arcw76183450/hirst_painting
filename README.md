# hirst_painting

This Python application generates a Hirst-style painting using an existing image as the basis. The Hirst style is characterized by a grid of colored circles, similar to the works of Damien Hirst.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hirst_painting.git
cd hirst_painting
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To generate a Hirst painting, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

Select `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image you want to use as the basis for the painting. If no image is selected, default image will be selected.
The application will then create a Hirst-style painting based on the colors present in the original image.
